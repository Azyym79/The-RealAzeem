  I’m an R&B songwriter and composer with over 18 years of experience creating songs that blend emotion, groove, and timeless storytelling. I’ve written more than 30 original songs and released my own album — all streaming now on Spotify and YouTube. My music carries the richness and flavor of classic soul, layered with melodies and emotion that resonate with today’s sound.

My inspiration comes from the legends who shaped the art of R&B — Stevie Wonder, Michael Jackson, R. Kelly, Usher, Ne-Yo, Boyz II Men, Joe, The Weeknd, Bruno Mars, and D’Angelo — artists who understood that true music lives in feeling, truth, and timeless grooves. But my foundation runs even deeper, rooted in the disco and funk era, shaped by icons like James Brown, The Gap Band, and Kool & The Gang, whose rhythms, horns, and energy gave birth to the sound that still moves the world today.

I play piano and guitar, and I’m deeply involved in every part of my creative process — from songwriting and arranging to shaping the tone, rhythm, and soul of each track. My music reflects years of studying and absorbing the evolution of R&B, funk, and soul — giving my compositions a depth and authenticity that listeners can instantly feel.

Now based in Canada, I’m expanding my reach to collaborate and pitch songs to R&B artists in the U.S., connecting with voices that want to tell real stories through melody and soul. If you’re looking for songs that groove, move, and last — let’s create something unforgettable.
